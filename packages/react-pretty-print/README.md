# TerminusDB-LIVE-PATTERN-LIBRARY

This is a UI component library that will have a wide range of building blocks available to the terminators.
Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component. (in the future we'll use other library too)

## Requirements

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [NodeJS 8.1.4+](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation
All the Components can be used as either a Node.js module available through the npm registry, or directly included in web-sites by including the script tag.

## How is the repo structured?
The TerminusDB-LIVE-PATTERN-LIBRARY repo is managed as a monorepo that is composed of many npm packages.


## Components naming convection

1)Package name : each word written in lowercase and divided by "-" E.g., react-componentname

2)Filename: Use PascalCase . E.g., ReservationCard.js
